It's been 3 days since I stopped blogging on my telegram channel. I do understand that sharing with your experience is must do thing as I'm striving to improve
our current Uzbek IT Community. In order to achieve this, I have to create resources that will be enough informative and yet easy to find when needed.
Telegram's indexing system does not provide such feature. Therefore, I decided to continue micro blogging my thoughts and experience on my personal website.

My blogs will be written in `long read` format and try to be informative as much as possible. I will try to cover all the details and provide links to the
resources and also make references to existing sources. I've been inspired by [Yetim Dasturchi](https://t.me/yetimdasturchi) to start blogging in this format.

As of you, my dear subbies, just checkout my RSS feeds located at `https://katsuki.moe/feed.xml`

By the way, my short posts will be posted on my twitter profile at `https://twitter.com/yurionterminal`. So, you're welcome to follow me there and stay keep in
touch.

_Keep programming, stop coding! Deez nuts..._
